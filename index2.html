  /*
    A note about properties : 
      React is a pretty forgiving library in what it allows you to do. 
      However, one of the rules you MUST follow is that components may not change their own props. You can use any way you please(such as by copying them into a new variable) so long as their values are not directly mutated.

    State: 
      The first thing to keep in mind about state is that it cannot be directly mutated. This is due to the fact when state is changed or mutated directly, the component will not rerender. 

      setState is the method for changing state within a component, and is how React tells that component to rerender.
  
  */

  class App extends React.Component {
    constructor(props){
      super(props); // In object oriented programming, you have to call the constructor of the parent class when you are inheriting from it.

      // Common example of object inheritance:
      /*
                  Shape(size)
        Rectangle(inherits from Shape, has access to size any other properties)
        Circle(inherits from Shape)

        Square(inherits from rectangle)
        Sphere(inherits from Circle)

        So our App that extends React.Component gains access to the methods and properties within React.Component. This also means that we have to use the constructor of React.component when we define our own.

// When we use our state within a field on an editable element, they become "controlled" components. This means they pull their values from pieces of the application that do not have an inherent way to change, so you cannot update their values from the webpage directly.
// One way to get around this is defaultValue. This will allow you to edit the value, but the changes will not be reflected in the application's actual state. You will need to grab that value again when you want to use it.

// In order to have a field that is tied to state and updates the state directly, you must provide an onChange
// Data flows downwards. 
// Neither parent or child components know if their parents or children are 'stateful' or 'stateless', and should not care whether it is defined as a class or a function. 

// This is why state is called local, because it is not accessible by any other components on the page. Only the component that the state belongs do may modify it, and view it directly. You can pass state as props to other components, but never directly modify it.
